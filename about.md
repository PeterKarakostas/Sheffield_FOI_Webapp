# About Sheffield FOI Explorer

The **Sheffield FOI Explorer** is a proof-of-concept platform designed to make Freedom of Information (FOI) requests more accessible to the public, journalists, researchers, and decision-makers.

## 🎯 Project Purpose

Every year, Sheffield City Council receives hundreds of FOI requests. While these are publicly available on platforms like WhatDoTheyKnow, they are not easily searchable, summarised, or analysed for patterns. This project aims to:

- **Make FOI data more discoverable and searchable.**
- **Use AI to summarise and tag requests for faster insights.**
- **Provide data-driven visualisations to highlight trends.**
- **Help the public check if their question has already been answered.**
- **Support the council in reducing duplicate FOI workloads.**

## 🧠 Technology Behind the Project

- **Python Automation** to scrape FOI data from WhatDoTheyKnow.
- **Azure OpenAI Service** to generate insights and tag themes.
- **GitHub Pages Web Application** to make insights accessible online.
- **JavaScript (Chart.js)** for interactive data visualisations.

## 🗺️ Alignment with Sheffield City Goals

This project supports the **Sheffield City Goals**, particularly:
- **Transparency and Accountability** – by making Freedom of Information data more accessible to the public and promoting civic engagement.
- **Efficient Public Services** – by helping the City Council better handle FOI requests, reducing workloads and improving efficiency.
- **Inclusive Decision Making** – by ensuring that citizens, journalists, and researchers can easily find relevant information, encouraging informed participation.
